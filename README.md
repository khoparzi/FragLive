# FragLive

FragLive is an effort to make a stable/low-latency AV setup as an extension of my TidalCycles performance system.

This is heavily inspired and takes the base code from the work of Tadokoro's [100Fragments](https://github.com/tado/Tidal100fragments/tree/master/100fragmentsLive).

Please note that it uses my own fork of [ofxTidalCycles](https://github.com/khoparzi/ofxTidalCycles) for now until the changes are pushed upstream.
