# FragLive

FragLive is an effort to make a stable/low-latency AV setup as an extension of my [TidalCycles](https://github.com/khoparzi/TidalSetup) performance system. The idea is to have a separate app or device (think another computer, or ofx capable SBC like RPi or Nvidia Jetson Nano) that handles visual duties based on OSC messages from SuperDirt and my TouchOSC patch.

This is heavily inspired and takes the base code from the work of Tadokoro's [100Fragments](https://github.com/tado/Tidal100fragments/tree/master/100fragmentsLive).

Please note that it uses my own fork of [ofxTidalCycles](https://github.com/khoparzi/ofxTidalCycles) for now until(and if) the changes are pushed upstream.
